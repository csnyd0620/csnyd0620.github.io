	<h4>Brief Introduction</h4>
	<p>
	Welcome to my website! My name's Christian, but you can call me Chris (and sometimes I go by Jace) for short! I'm a Spring 2024 graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science looking to put my degree to work! I worked at a local Great American Cookies for the almost the past three years, land unfortunately our entire staff got laid off, as did a couple other stores in the franchise, so now I'm trying to put my hard-earned degree to use. 
	</p>
	<p>With this site, I'm hoping to prove I didn't just skate by and pass classes to get the degree. You'll find a lot of information about my skills, my experience and some random information about the weather (or is it random?). Please feel free to click through everything, as I hope this will be a showcase of skills and capabiities that I would bring to whomever chooses to employ me at their company!
	</p>
	
	<h4>Where do I want to work?</h4>
	<p>
	I'm open to any position that would let me gain experience in my field of study! I'm open to help desk, IT support (your computer's running slow? alright, just for the checklist, let's turn it back on and off again, and then go from there!), writing code (like this site!), development - whatever someone feels like I'd be a good fit for. I'd also be interested in anything to do with the weather - working on a radar system, or helping to tweak the code of weather models, or even just help get the data from the radiosonde launches would be so cool, to name a couple things. I don't have any formal education or experience, but I'm somewhat of a hobbyist. If you're curious, you should <a href="weatherpage.html">check out</a> that weather page!
	</p>	
	<p>
	I've worked with Java primarily as part of my education. I'm the most comfortable with that language overall and most of my projects, personal or school, have been in Java. I did work with PHP as part of a position while I was in my undergrad classes, and I'll be adding it on this site as proof I've worked with it. I have worked in C++ for a couple of projects, though I'd need to become much more familar with it for it to be a primary language to work with. I don't know if you've notice a trend, but I like lanaguages that are more structured, and need that instead of say, Python. I have used Python occasionally while I was part of a cybersecurity club at my college, but if given a choice, I prefer other languages. Phython tends to be a language I'm not a big fan of due to the less-structured nature of it, to some extent. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I plan to put some of my past personal and school projects on my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> for download, as well as examples of code I've written as part of them. Feel free to play around with them, and see how their code is written. I hope it will give a good idea of what I'm able to do and my typical style of work.
	</p>
	<p>
	I did want to go ahead and bring up the topic of pay...because, unfortunately, I need to pay my bills. I'd be aiming for at least 45,000 a year USD to start, and I'd go from there. More than that would be awesome, and 55-60k/year would be very cool, if on the higher end. My last position I was making a little under the lower end (41k), and I'm trying to get my actual career going, on top of paying the bills and maybe even buy a house someday, and that would be the lower end of what I'd prefer to make. I know being entry level doesn't pay six-figures, but 45k seems like a good start, doesn't it?
	</p>
	
	<h4>What am I like as a person?</h4>
	<p>
	Hard working, dedicated....I mean, yes, I am, but those are dime a dozen as descriptors and I'm trying to seem interesting here. I'm definitely down to be friendly, even if sometimes it takes a minute to get the dynamics of a conversation sorted. In tech, a lot of us can relate to that, I'd say, right? I do, however, take care to ensure I'm able to maintain good working relationships with people, be polite and kind, and do my best to be professional. I could be a genius with Java, but if I'm abrasive, it won't be enjoyable to work with me, and those soft-skills are valuable. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I  will say this as an indicator of my interpersonal skills and relationships - at my last position, I started as cashier, and worked up to General Manager. I didn't do it by shoving my way up and pushing people down - in fact, I didn't even aim to take that role to begin with. Circumstances just occured that put me in the position to be the best suited to take over when the previous manager left, and I cared too much about my place of work and my coworkers to turn down the role. My coworkers deserved to work in a place they enjoyed, and it be run by someone that was willing to do the neccesary work while not thinking of themselves as better than the people under them. I always viewed that role as a position of service - to them, to our customers. The manager who trained me lived that out at work, and I was determined to live up to her standards even after she left. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I would bring that same drive, dedication and humility to any role I fufill. I might be the person on the job, but that never means I am "better" than anyone else - I'm always able to learn, and I'm always willing to try something new if it'll help finish whatever we're working on, whether that's an issue with a computer to be fixed or a new piece of software to develop. I made a slight joke abot it a minute ago, but I was raised to do my best and put my full effort to whatever I'm doing, and that's something that has served me well in previous experiences. 
	</p>
	<h5>Enough about work personality....what about me as a person <i>outside</i> of work?</h6>
	<p> 
	Enthusiastic, fun, and friendly especially once I feel comfortable (not at the expense of responsibilities, though!). I'm not always a social butterfly, but in the right enviroments I love to make friends, go out with friends and generally have a good time. I'm a long-time attendee of DragonCon, down in Atlanta, Georgia, maybe you've heard of this local convention... that has over 70k attendee's anually? 
	</p>
	<!-- Insert picture of a cosplay here, probably my twilek-->
	<p id ="picture_info">
	<img src = "" alt = "A picture of Chris in a Jedi cosplay. It has gold and blue thick shoulder straps (tabbards), a blue and gold belt, and white and tan tunic. The pants are tan. Chris is wearing a headpiece that has two tail-like pieces hanging down past their shoulders that are designed as lekku from Twilek's from Star Wars. Chris is holding a black lightsaber that the light is set to yellow, almost gold, as the color." />

	Yes, that is me in that picture! And yes, I did make that outfit (mostly. I have yet to make pants, or shoes, but I might be able to tackle pants here - the headpiece in the picture above, ironically, helped get the "how" of how to make pants click, of all things), and I've made a few other cosplay outfits too. I started, back in my early teens, with a run to the local Goodwill and what I had in my closet for my first outfit, and now, I'm planning on making a full Mandalorian suit sometime in the next few years. The goal is before next DragonCon, but I'm not going to beat myself up if it doesn't happen. Real life comes first. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Cosplay - and conventions and fandom as a whole - has been an important part of my life, and has impacted me significantly enough to where I easily credit it to the development of my stregnths as a person. I wouldn't be as good of a writer as I can be without having done some fandom-related writing, and I wouldn't be anywhere near as socialable if I hadn't been able to attend conventions with other just as nerdy people as me, get comfortable and then branch out from there. The commitment I have to finishing things is in part, due to my commitment to finishing my cosplays. Maybe a smaller part than how I was raised, but developing the patience, ethic and pacing of work and rest to not burn out is something I have easily improved as part of working on cosplays. I'm also a part of local community servers online as a result of being in fandom servers, one for state weather, one for tropical, one for local events, one even for local developers and other folks in tech-related positions. I have made many friends as a part of fandom communities and their impact on my life and what I've chosen to do as a career can't be overlooked. 
	</p>
	<h4>Chris, come on, what about the weather? I'm getting a bit impatient.</h4>
	<p>
	Yes, yes, I'm sure you're also asking what's up with all the weather mentions? Why do I have a section about weather on a portfolio primarily about my desire to work with technology? 
	</p> 
	<p>
	Glad you asked! The short answer is I'm a weather nerd. Over the past few years, I've discovered that I'm really, really interested in meteorology. It's fascinating, the way that the atmosphere interacts with Earth and how that can cause thin little clouds to massive hurricanes. I used to be terrified of thunder - why is a little hard to pin down, it might have been the loudness, but it might have simply been that I didn't know why it was happening, or what the loud storm was about to do, and if that was going to put me in danger. A few years ago, I thought, maybe if I learn about storms, and why they happen, and how to predict them, or track them, it'll help with the anxiety I get. 
	</p> 
	<p><i>And the rest was history.</i></p>
	<p>
	It technically started with Hurricane Irma. I don't quite remember why I started watching it, but I do remember that I kept watching it becasue it was on track to hit us, back in Gwinnett. And it did. We lost power for a day or so, but didn't loose our house and the most damage we had was fallen trees in the yard, but I remember sitting through the storm on the first floor, watching the trees swaying through the second floor level windows (log cabin style house, the upstairs was a loft style above half the house, the living room was tall on the other half) and being a bit awe'd by the sheer intensity. I had spent the last week or so watching it come through the gulf and up the coast, and the why's and how's and what it was doing were incredibly interesting to me. It took a couple years after Irma to get into the overall study instead of just hurricanes, but weather as a whole has swept me into it's grasp and probably will put me down somewhere I didn't expect all those years ago. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If it's feasable, I want to eventually obtain a master's degree in a meteorology related field, probably for a future job in relation to the modeling, or the data itself. I don't neccesarily want to be a TV forecaster, but the data and work behind the scenes so that they can do their jobs? I think I'd enjoy that a lot. This fall, I do plan to become a storm spotter with the National Weather Service - they offer training I'm signed up for and if I'm certified, I get to watch severe weather and be an on the ground source for any storms that might be producing something dangerous. If there's a radar observed tornado warning, and I'm nearby and see it forming a funnel or putting a tornado down, that would give them the ability to change the "radar indicated" to "observed", which makes future tracking easier, and helps them emphasize the danger.

	<p>However, if I go on much more about it here, it'll take up half the page, and I already have a specific place dedicated to it on this site, so if you're intruiged by my interest in weather, or want to see some quite frankly awesome pictures, click on over to "<a href="weatherpage">And now, the weather!</a>".
