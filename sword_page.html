            This is without a doubt, the project constantly sitting at the back of my mind. I'm a weather nerd, if you missed that, and for my senior project, I wanted to incorperate my love of weather with the skills I'd gained over the course of my education. The long term goal is to have two versions of this software, a desktop and a web based. I'd call the desktop version DeskSWORD, and the web version Light/LiteSWORD.

            ....hopefully I mentioned somewhere on this site I'm also a huge Star Wars nerd. If my (probably terrible) joke didn't make sense, go back and read the last sentence with "huge Star Wars nerd" in mind.

        <p>Ahem. Anyways, this is something I hope to fully complete as I have time, and if the NOAA/NWS were to find it useful, perhaps even work with them on adapting this for their and the general public's use. This is not something I wish to make money from <i>unless</i> it remains open source. I believe in spreading knowledge, and not locking important tools behind a paywall in that regard, espeically if it's in regards to things that can impact someone's literal survival (aka, the weather, if it's bad enough).

            Here's a couple pictures of the program as I submitted it. It's not done, and I've made improvements since, so this isn't current, but it's still a proof of concept.
