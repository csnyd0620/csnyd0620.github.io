Objective 1: 
Use php to standardize the navigation menu and call it as a fucntion. 
    I'm pretty sure you can do that, actually, i think we did it for ung. 

    so as an example of what I'm thinking about : 
        <h1>$pagename</h1> for each page 
        $functionToDisplayNavBar - as the div part of the page, but only need to create it once, and then just call this function on every other page.
        <section>Main section</section>
        $betaVersionDisclaimer - include the disclaimer as part of the standard header
        <hr> - need to include this as standard part of header as well

    TODO: Dig through website code if i still have it to see if that's in there somewhere. 

Objective 2: Figure out why the About Me page is bothering me and adjust the layout/setup.
