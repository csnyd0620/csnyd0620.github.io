        Hurricane Irma knocked out our power, and sparked my love for hurricanes. A few years later, I wondered if learning about other severe weather would help me deal with my storm anxiety. The phrase from the recent tornado movie Twisters, "You don't run from your fears, you ride them." proved true for me. If a storm is headed my way, expect me to be glued to radar, the National Weather Service, and possibly out storm chasing.

        If it's feasable, I want to eventually obtain a master's degree in a meteorology related field, probably for a future job in relation to the modeling, or the data itself. I don't neccesarily want to be a TV forecaster, but the data and work behind the scenes so that they can do their jobs? I think I'd enjoy that a lot. This fall, I do plan to become a storm spotter with the National Weather Service - they offer training I'm signed up for and if I'm certified, I get to watch severe weather and be an on the ground source for any storms that might be producing something dangerous. If there's a radar observed tornado warning, and I'm nearby and see it forming a funnel or putting a tornado down, that would give them the ability to change the "radar indicated" to "observed", which makes future tracking easier, and helps them emphasize the danger.
