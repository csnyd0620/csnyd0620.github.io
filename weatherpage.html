            Hurricane Irma knocked out our power, and sparked my love for watching hurricanes. A few years later, I wondered if learning about other severe weather would help me deal with my storm anxiety. The phrase from the recent tornado movie Twisters, "You don't run from your fears, you ride them." proved true for me. If a storm is headed my way, expect me to be glued to radar, the National Weather Service, and possibly out storm chasing.

            I'm mostly self studied, as in I read this fun book called "Weather Analysis and Forecasting Handbook (1st edition)", read through MetEd's site amosgst others, google'd a lot, asked a bunch of questions and in October of 2024, I plan to take the SKYWARN class and become a certified spotter! That's not everything, but it's a decent overview of how I'm studying.

            If it's feasable, I want to eventually obtain a master's degree in a meteorology related field, probably for a future job in relation to the modeling, or the data itself. I don't neccesarily want to be a TV forecaster, but the data and work behind the scenes so that they can do their jobs? I think I'd enjoy that a lot. This fall, I do plan to become a storm spotter with the National Weather Service - they offer training I'm signed up for and if I'm certified, I get to watch severe weather and be an on the ground source for any storms that might be producing something dangerous. If there's a radar observed tornado warning, and I'm nearby and see it forming a funnel or putting a tornado down, that would give them the ability to change the "radar indicated" to "observed", which makes future tracking easier, and helps them emphasize the danger.

            I did actually buy a weather station this year - it doesn't link up to the NWS or WeatherUnderground, I didn't have enough money at the time for the wi-fi model, but it does track data and store it, so that's enough for now. When Helene came through Georgia, we just got the eye, but I did record a wind gust of 17mph, and it could have been higher, but I'd moved the station to a slightly more secure location that didn't get the full brunt of things. It's zip tied to a chair right now, because I can't attach it to the apartment.

            Weather patterns fascinate me, the way that the atmosphere interacts with Earth and how that can cause thin little clouds to massive hurricanes, or turn air into spinning columns of dirt, debrie and water, to name a couple examples of why. But like I've said, I wasn't always a huge fan of storms. Hearing thunder rolling through used to spike my heart rate from anxiety, not from excitement. The why is a little hard to pin down, it might have been the loudness, but it might have simply been that I didn't know why it was happening, or what the loud storm was about to do, and if that was going to put me in danger. Now, I do know how to find out what it's doing, if it's dangerous, how to see where it's going and that made the sound of thunder comforting, not terrifying.

            What's fun about weather - and meterology as a whole - is that a BS in CS is actually incredibly relevant. It's not enough to be a forecaster - and quite frankly, I don't want to be the person on TV talking about the upcoming weathr - but it's enough to provide a foundation for working with the behind-the-scenes aspect. Modeling in particular is now a computer heavy field, becuase the models we use today are done via computer analysis of patterns and known factors, not just by hand anymore. GFS, ECMWF, ICON, WRF - those are all models used in various ways thoughout the careers that might be summed up by "about weather".

            I recently emailed my local NWS office (yes, you can do that - isn't that ridiculously cool????) to ask about models and how they worked, what the differences in coding were, etc. Hurricane Helene had just barreled through the country and some of the models for that storm had been different enough from one another that I was curious as to what might have influenced their outputs. I did learn that the WRF is coded in Fortran, amongst a couple others, but that's the primary language, which I thought was neat. When I emailed the local office, though, I got an answer to that, and learned about the specific field I'd eventually like to be a part of - data assimilation. Numerical weather prediction is another topic that sounds interesting too.

            I mentioned on my About page that I go storm chasing on occasion. I've been...four or five times now, and so far three of them have resulted in some truly spectacular pictures. The other two times were fun but to some extent, a "bust" on that front. It didn't make my desire to go again any colder, though, just gave me more reasons to go again and again. Eventually, I'd like to get a weather station that I can attach to my car and feed the data to the NWS. It would be somewhat redundant at home, since it would be stationary a good chunk of the time, but two stations transmitting data would probably still be recieved warmly by other weather nerds and folks at the NWS.

            Below are going to be some pictures I've taken from various chases, or when I've just been out and about and snapped a good picture. I've got pleennnntty more of them, but I can only post so many before it starts slowing the site down.
