        Hurricane Irma knocked out our power, and sparked my love for hurricanes. A few years later, I wondered if learning about other severe weather would help me deal with my storm anxiety. The phrase from the recent tornado movie Twisters, "You don't run from your fears, you ride them." proved true for me. If a storm is headed my way, expect me to be glued to radar, the National Weather Service, and possibly out storm chasing.
