This is the repository for my portfolio website. 
This site is until further notice, in beta. It is constantly being updated as needs arise. 
I will occasionally update it as I add projects and gain experience. 

## As of 10/11/24, static site is made available again. To view the dynamic site code, please view the branch labeled "main". 

### 10/8/27
List of tasks to be done:
1. Create standardized title header, ~~navbar and beta disclaimer section~~ of pages to be refernced with php. 
2. Replace all current title headers, ~~navbars, and beta disclaimeers~~ with function referncing the script written in step 1. 
3. Use that page to create a standard template for any additional pages for ease of code. 

* TODO: Create a stylesheet specifically for projects sheet
* TODO: ~~Fork and convert all pages to .php, so that the PHP actually works. Incorperate CodeIgniter framework - templates?~~
    * Fork created, viewable in branch "main". Not viewable with GitHub pages, so will remain source code for now.
