This is the repository for my portfolio website. 
This site is until further notice, in beta. It is constantly being updated as needs arise. 
I will occasionally update it as I add projects and gain experience. 


# 10/8/27
List of tasks to be done:
1. Create standardized title header, navbar and beta disclaimer section of pages to be refernced with php. 
2. Replace all current title headers, navbars, and beta disclaimes with function referncing the script written in step 1. 
3. Use that page to create a standard template for any additional pages for ease of code. 


TODO: Create a stylesheet specifically for projects sheet

TODO: Fork and convert all pages to .php, so that the PHP actually works.
